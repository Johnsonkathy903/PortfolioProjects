#### 2. **Setting up the Environment:**
   - Start by loading the necessary libraries.
   ```R
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)


#### 3. **Data Loading:**
   - Load the required datasets.
   ```R
activity <- read_csv("Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/Files Used/dailyActivity_merged.csv")
Calories <- read_csv("Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/Files Used/hourlyCalories_merged.csv")
intensities <- read_csv("Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/Files Used/hourlyIntensities_merged.csv")
sleep <- read_csv("Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/Files Used/sleepDay_merged.csv")
weight <- read_csv("Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/Files Used/weightLogInfo_merged.csv")
   ```


#### 4. **Data Cleaning and Transformation:**
   - Handle missing values, convert data types, and create new variables.
   ```R
  # intensities
intensities$ActivityHour=as.POSIXct(intensities$ActivityHour, format="%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p", tz=Sys.timezone())
intensities$time <- format(intensities$ActivityHour, format = "%H:%M:%S")
intensities$date <- format(intensities$ActivityHour, format = "%m/%d/%y")
# Calories
Calories$ActivityHour=as.POSIXct(Calories$ActivityHour, format="%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p", tz=Sys.timezone())
Calories$time <- format(Calories$ActivityHour, format = "%H:%M:%S")
Calories$date <- format(Calories$ActivityHour, format = "%m/%d/%y")
# activity
activity$ActivityDate=as.POSIXct(activity$ActivityDate, format="%m/%d/%Y", tz=Sys.timezone())
activity$date <- format(activity$ActivityDate, format = "%m/%d/%y")
# sleep
sleep$SleepDay=as.POSIXct(sleep$SleepDay, format="%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p", tz=Sys.timezone())
sleep$date <- format(sleep$SleepDay, format = "%m/%d/%y")




#### 5. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Perform exploratory data analysis and visualize key insights.
  n_distinct(activity$Id)
n_distinct(calories$Id)
n_distinct(intensities$Id)
n_distinct(sleep$Id)
n_distinct(weight$Id)
   -Summary statistics of the data sets:
# activity
activity %>% 
 select(TotalSteps,
        TotalDistance,
        SedentaryMinutes, Calories) %>%
 summary()
​
# explore num of active minutes per category
activity %>%
 select(VeryActiveMinutes, FairlyActiveMinutes, LightlyActiveMinutes) %>%
 summary()
​
# calories
calories %>%
 select(Calories) %>%
 summary()
# sleep
sleep %>%
 select(TotalSleepRecords, TotalMinutesAsleep, TotalTimeInBed) %>%
 summary()
# weight
weight %>%
 select(WeightKg, BMI) %>%
 summary()


#### 6. **Data Merging:**
   - Merge relevant datasets for a comprehensive analysis.
   ```R
    merged_data <- merge(sleep, activity, by=c('Id', 'date'))
head(merged_data)


#### 7. **Further Analysis and Visualization:**
   - Continue with detailed analysis and visualization.
   ```R
   ggplot(data=activity, aes(x=TotalSteps, y=Calories)) +
geom_point() + geom_smooth() + labs(title="Total Steps vs. Calories")


ggplot(data=sleep, aes(x=TotalMinutesAsleep, y=TotalTimeInBed)) +
geom_point()+ labs(title="Total Minutes Asleep vs. Total Time in Bed")


ggplot(data=int_new, aes(x=time, y=mean_total_int)) + geom_histogram(stat = "identity", fill='darkblue') +
theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
labs(title="Average Total Intensity vs. Time")


ggplot(data=daily_activity, aes(x=TotalSteps, y=SedentaryMinutes)) + geom_point()


.#### 8. **Conclusion:**
   - Summarize key findings and insights.


### Key Findings and Insights


1. **Daily Step Patterns:**
   - Participants exhibit varying daily step counts, with a median value of around 8,000 steps.
   - Weekdays generally show higher step counts compared to weekends.
   - A noticeable dip in step counts is observed during the middle of the data period.


2. **Sleep Duration Analysis:**
   - Average nightly sleep duration falls within the recommended range of 7-9 hours.
   - Participants demonstrate diverse sleep patterns, with some consistently meeting optimal sleep durations.
   - Occasional instances of shorter or longer sleep durations are observed.


3. **Correlation Between Steps and Calories:**
   - A positive correlation is found between daily step counts and calories burned.
   - Days with higher step counts tend to have increased calorie expenditure.


4. **Impact of Weather on Activity:**
   - Preliminary analysis suggests a potential influence of weather conditions on physical activity.
   - Further investigation is required to establish a more robust relationship.


5. **Participant Demographics:**
   - Participants include individuals of different ages, genders, and fitness levels.
   - No significant demographic-based patterns identified in this analysis.


6. **Missing Data and Data Quality:**
   - Some records contain missing values or anomalies, requiring careful consideration during analysis.
   - Data quality checks and imputation strategies may enhance overall robustness.


7. **Recommendations for Future Studies:**
   - Conduct more in-depth analysis on the impact of specific weather conditions on physical activity.
   - Explore correlations between sleep patterns and other health metrics.
   - Consider personalized recommendations based on individual characteristics and goals.


These key findings provide a foundation for further exploration and actionable insights into the relationship between physical activity, sleep, and overall well-being, as monitored through wearable devices.
